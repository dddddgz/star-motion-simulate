## Project Settings

### Language Settings

If you want to change the language of the game, you can open `config/config.ini`, find the `default` option under `[language]`, and change it to the language you want to display (such as `zh-CN`).

### Load simulation

Do the following steps:

1. Open the `simulation` folder
2. Select a file you want to use
3. Copy its filename (*do not copy the suffix*)
4. Open `config/config.ini`
5. Locate the `file` section under `[simulation]`
6. Paste the file name
7. Run the program (if the program is already running, close it and run it again)

> You can also create your own simulations in the `simulation` folder. If you think it's good, you can fork this project and [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/dddddgz/star-motion-simulate/pulls)
