# Pygame celestial motion simulation

## Introduction

This is a celestial motion simulation program.

**âš  Attention! The project requires 100% scaling to run on *Windows*. Incorrect scaling can result in a poor experience.**

Prepare:

```
# macOS
python3 -m install pyini pygame

# Windows
python -m pip install pyini pygame
```
## Project Settings

### Language Settings

If you want to change the language of the game, you can open `config/config.ini`, find the `default` option under `[language]`, and change it to the language you want to display (such as `zh-CN`).

### Load simulation

Do the following steps:

1. Open the `simulation` folder
2. Select a file you want to use
3. Copy its filename (*do not copy the suffix*)
4. Open `config/config.ini`
5. Locate the `file` section under `[simulation]`
6. Paste the file name
7. Run the program (if the program is already running, close it and run it again)

> You can also create your own simulations in the `simulation` folder. If you think it's good, you can fork this project and [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/dddddgz/star-motion-simulate/pulls)

## Instructions

> This part introduces how to operate the program after it is running.
