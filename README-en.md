# Pygame celestial motion simulation

## Introduction

This is a celestial motion simulation program.

**⚠Attention! The project requires 100% scaling to run on *Windows*. Incorrect scaling can result in a poor experience. **

## Project Settings

### language settings

If you want to change the language of the game, you can open `config/config.ini`, find the `default` option under `[language]`, and change it to the language you want to display (such as `zh`).

2. Select a file you want to use
3. Copy its filename (*do not copy the suffix*)
4. Open `config/config.ini`
5. Locate the `file` section under `[simulation]`
6. Paste the file name
7. Run the program (if the program is already running, close it and run it again)

> You can also press the `Ctrl+S` key combination in the game to export the current state of the simulation.  
> If you think it is good, you can Fork this project and [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/dddddgz/star-motion-simulate/pulls).
